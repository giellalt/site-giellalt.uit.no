# Converting Docs To Markdown

As we continue to move to GitHub, we also need to update our documentation infrastructure. The basic ideas are as follows:

* we use the default site building features of GitHub
* this requires the use of Markdown; most features of
  html, forrest-xml and jspwiki can be replicated in Markdown, with a few excepsions:
    - all source formats:
        - definition lists: these are converted to regular lists with some extra formatting
    to make them look mostly like definition lists
    - html/forrest-xml:
        - warnings and other message boxes: can probably be replicated as citation blocks, but
    that neeeds manual conversion

#  Conversion commands

##  Jspwiki ⇒ Markdown

```
gawk -f $GIELLA_CORE/scripts/jspwiki2md.awk WhatIsThis.jspwiki > WhatIsThis.md
```

##  Forrest XML ⇒ Markdown

Must be done in two steps:

1. xml ⇒ html
1. html ⇒ Markdown

The commands are:

```
saxonXSL -s:docu-smj-lex.xml -xsl:$GIELLA_CORE/devtools/forrest_xml2plain_xml.xsl > test.html
pandoc -f html -t gfm test.html -o test.md
```

Information on `pandoc` is found at the bottom.

To process many files at a time, wrap the above commands in a `for` loop or similar:

```
for i in *.xml; do echo $i; saxonXSL -s:$i -xsl:$GIELLA_CORE/devtools/forrest_xml2plain_xml.xsl -o:$i.html; done
find . -name "*.ht*" | while read i; do pandoc -f html -t gfm "$i" -o "${i%.*}.md"; done
```

And finally, to retain document history, it is best to do content change and document renaming as two distinct operations, due to `git`s unwillingness to track files. That is, do as follows:

1. change content format, retain filename (ie overwrite the old file)
1. git add + commit
1. change the file name to match new content
1. git add + commit

This way `git` will be able to track the file history across the file renames.

#  Aftermath

When all documents are converted, one needs to check and update links. Documentation internal links should point directly to the Markdown files (link to `test.md`, not to `test.html`), while external links should be complete URL's.

Beware of `html` files that should NOT be converted, e.g. speller test result pages. Such pages will be rendered as is, with the information given in the html source, using CSS, JS and everything. If the automatic processing above have turned such pages into Markdown, the change must be reversed before committing - GitHub Pages can't handle custom JS at all AFAIK.

#  pandoc

Install `pandoc` using MacPorts, Brew or download package:

* `sudo port install pandoc`
* `brew install pandoc`
* [Installer package for download](https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/tag/2.11.3.2)
